Hello!

I am a senior manager of clinical operations analytics in the healthcare industry. I enjoy understanding and improving healthcare systems through visualization and analytics.

I was in the Peace Corps in Namibia, studied public health and epidemiology and have worked in either public health or healthcare since 2012. I live in Atlanta, GA and grew up in Salt Lake City, UT.
